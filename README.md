Inferring stylistic constraints in art

This is a collection of routines for calculating the number and volume fraction variances of point patterns and images.

The purpose of this project is to use volume fraction variance as an indicator of underlying stylistic constraints employed during the creation of artworks.

Example notebooks illustrate the use of each of the functions.
